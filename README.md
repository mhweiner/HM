# HM
HM is a JS view component and jQuery plugin for Mustache. Issues callbacks within new scope, so you can encapsulate your view logic, and have it run when it's ready. Each view/component can have its own API, so you can keep your components modular and completely isolated. At only 1.2kb gzipped, it's much more lightweight than any other component/templating library.
